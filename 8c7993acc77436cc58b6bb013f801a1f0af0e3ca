I like the re-wording, it's not a big difference, but it makes sense. I was also surprised during the SoS that there was confusion about support channels.

I didn't know about `webchat` - though I see it's listed in the IRC page. Changing the link on that page to `webchat` (e.g. `https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#symfony`) would be friendlier - I'd be +1 on it, though we don't really know if this is a real problem.

Good that you did the Dutch translation also. I like the difference and I agree with Ryan.

Very friendly ping here. I know it's a big stress to the feature freeze, but I would like to improve the experience of help-seeking community members.

@WouterJ thanks for the ping. I totally forgot about this. I'm sorry.

I like your proposal ... but it has a flaw. It doesn't fit the design:

![proposal_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73419/14231710/79d4945e-f98d-11e5-9063-f8a92e29718c.png)

What about tweaking the message a bit?

What happend to the old forums, what decision was made to deprecate these? I can imagine that not all users who seek help are able and willing to join an irc server.

@RicardoJ the old forums were replaced by StackOverflow.

@javiereguiluz what about "to ask/answer specific Symfony problems." I think the fact that you need a very specific problem in order to have a correct question on SO is really important.

@javiereguiluz That makes sense. To go back on topic; The new string makes sense, but in Dutch, the whole string doesn't make sense to me unless @WouterJ agrees on the translation:

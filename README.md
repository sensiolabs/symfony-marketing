The Symfony Website Content
===========================

This repository hosts most the content of the symfony.com website.

This is where you should submit pull requests if you find a typo somewhere on
the Symfony website, or if you want to translate its content to another
language.

To translate the content in another language, just create a new directory
named after the locale (es for Spanish for instance), and re-create the same
directory/file structure.

**Before contributing, please read
[contribution information](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-marketing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md)
to make sure everything will be okay.**

You don't need to translate everything in one pull request. When a user
encounters a non translated page, it will have the choice to fallback to the
same page in English in any other translated language.

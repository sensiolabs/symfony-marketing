@weaverryan sorry for being so pushy, but I'd like to add the information of your great component as soon as possible. Which one of the following should be the component name?

  * `Guard`
  * `SecurityGuard`

Thanks!

`Guard` or `Guard Auth` (still short, a little more descriptive). You're fast for getting this updated.

I don't know what to do here. Let's ask @fabpot: do you prefer `Guard` or `GuardAuth` as the component name? Thanks.

I would use `Guard`

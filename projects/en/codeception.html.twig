        Codeception is a full-stack testing framework which incorporates
        acceptance, functional, and unit testing. It uses a simple PHP DSL to
        describe test scenarios and includes over 20 modules to solve common
        problems. With Codeception you can get tests executed inside every
        popular PHP framework, use PhpBrowser (based on Guzzle), or run
        acceptance tests with Selenium WebDriver.

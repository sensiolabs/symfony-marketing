        Victoire is an open source content management system based on the full
        stack Symfony framework and built to create complex custom websites.
        Victoire uses Business Intelligence to manage the business entities of a
        project and display them on the website dedicated in a few clicks -
        without copying manually the texts and images of these business
        entities, one by one. Our project also uses Front-End Edition so the
        administrator can create and edit all his contents, directly on page.
        Victoire permits to create custom website that fits all devices and
        meets Google's criteria.
